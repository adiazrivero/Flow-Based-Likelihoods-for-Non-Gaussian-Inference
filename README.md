# Flow-Based Likelihoods for Non-Gaussian Inference


This repository cotains the code used for the paper [Flow-based Likelihoods for Non-Gaussian Inference (arXiv:....)] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05535). If you have any questions, please email me at adiazrivero@g.harvard.edu.

The flow-based model used in this work is based on [FFJORD](https://github.com/rtqichen/ffjord). *The directory called ffjord is a clone of their repository. If you have a question about the code there, please reach out directly to them.*

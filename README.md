# Flow-Based Likelihoods for Non-Gaussian Inference


This repository cotains the code used for the paper Flow-based Likelihoods for Non-Gaussian Inference (arXiv:....). As a disclaimer, I'm not a software engineer or computer scientist, as I'm sure you'll be able to tell by the code and documentation! While functional, it is likely not optimal.

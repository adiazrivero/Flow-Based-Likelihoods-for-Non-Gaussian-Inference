# Flow-Based Likelihoods for Non-Gaussian Inference


This repository cotains the code used for the paper Flow-based Likelihoods for Non-Gaussian Inference (arXiv:....). As a disclaimer, I'm not a software engineer or computer scientist, as I'm sure you'll be able to tell by the code and documentation! While functional, it is likely not optimal. If you have any questions, please email me at adiazrivero@g.harvard.edu.

The flow-based model used in this work is based on [FFJORD](https://github.com/rtqichen/ffjord). Please clone their repository before running this code, since we'll be using their code to build the model. Place it in a repository called "ffjord_original" within this repository. You will also need pytorch. Although CUDA is not mandatory, I did train the model on a GPU.

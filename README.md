# Flow-Based Likelihoods for Non-Gaussian Inference


This repository cotains the code used for the paper [Flow-based Likelihoods for Non-Gaussian Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05535). I can make the convergence maps used available upon request. The flow-based model used in this work is based on [FFJORD](https://github.com/rtqichen/ffjord).
